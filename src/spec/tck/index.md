## MVC 1.0 TCK

A TCK, or Technology Compatibility Kit, is one of the three required pieces for any JSR 
(the other two being the specification document and the reference implementation). 
The TCK is a set of tools and tests to verify that an implementation of the technology 
conforms to the specification.

The MVC 1.0 TCK is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0 and hosted in a GitHub repository.
