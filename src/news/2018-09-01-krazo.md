Ozark will change name to *Eclipse Krazo* when the move to Eclipse Foundation is made.
The reasoning for this is that one of the requirements for Eclipse Projects is that the name is not associated with any trademarks or potential trademarks. 
The name Ozark is simply used too many places for it to be a valid Eclipse project name.

After a long time with brainstorming, discussions and thinking, we ended up with *Krazo*.
