**The transfer of JSR 371 from Oracle is now complete!**

The transfer document is signed and everything is official. For those of you that feel the process has been a little lengthy, I can assure you that it is in the best interest of the community to get everything right from a legal perspective.

Join me in applauding Oracle for initiating this transfer. Now it is up to us to get the work done. **Let's dot this!**
